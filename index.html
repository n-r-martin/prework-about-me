      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a UX/UI Designer and Developer working as part of a Human Centered Design team for an IT Consulting firm here in Colorado. For a long time I've wanted to take my developent skills to the next level, which is why I enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver. I'm excited to see what I learn and where my new skills will take me!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Denver, Colorado</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love music. I mostly play guitar and piano, but doing anything creative with music is always fun and stimulating. I've also been getting into Printmaking as well, which is a lot of fun. I love the process, from sketching ideas and carving the blocks, as well as the production aspect of that medium. I also want to get into Game Development, which is partly why I'm taking this bootcamp!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If I could go back and do it all again, I'd want to be an astronaut, or at least work in the field of space exploration and any related science. But now I'd settle for a UX Developer position at NASA or the ESA. I also love to work with mapping technology, so any job where I could contribute to related applications would be amazing.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Denver, not far from DU!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have some background in front-end development, which has been incredibly useful in my UX Design career thus far. But I want to set myself up to be a competent UX Developer, thus boosting my professional value in the industry.</p>
